## What is One Time Pad?

One-time pad takes its name from the printing of a secret key onto a pad of piper whose top sheet could be torn off once used, limiting its use to just a single instance. One-time pad was used in concert with, or rather added to, Vernamâ€™s Cipher. One-time pad has been used for diplomatic communiques and by the KGB with exotic means of distributing, securing, and discarding secret keys, all of which speak to the obstacle of sensible key sharing with one-time pad.
