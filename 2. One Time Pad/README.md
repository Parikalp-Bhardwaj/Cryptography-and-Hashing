## What is One Time Pad?

One Time Pad algorithm is the improvement of the Vernam Cipher, proposed by An Army Signal Corp officer, Joseph Mauborgne. It is the only available algorithm that is unbreakable(completely secure). It is a method of encrypting alphabetic plain text. It is one of the Substitution techniques which converts plain text into ciphertext. In this mechanism, we assign a number to each character of the Plain-Text.


### The two requirements for the One-Time pad are
- The key should be randomly generated as long as the size of the message.
- The key is to be used to encrypt and decrypt a single message, and then it is discarded.
